"""rehost.py — re-host every foreign description image to our own CDN (Backend doc Q14), zero model tokens.
Added to the toolkit 2026-09-06 after blr-batch25, where this step was written ad hoc, crashed on Shopify
"Internal Server Error" responses with the created file ids only in memory, and left ~50 duplicate files in Files.

  python3 rehost.py [cdn_prefix]          # default cdn_prefix = cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0786/1269/3028/ (Worfa)

Reads extract/pNN.json (images[].src). For every src not on cdn_prefix:
  1. fileCreate in groups of 10 (originalSource = the foreign URL, Shopify fetches server-side; no staged upload).
     The returned ids are written to image_ids.json AFTER EVERY GROUP — a crash or re-run continues from that file,
     nothing is uploaded twice.
  2. Polls the ids until READY, writes foreign_url -> new CDN url to image_map.json. FAILED files are logged with the
     product index and URL and left untouched (the Backend doc: never push a broken image; never delete a source image).
  3. Rewrites images[].src in extract/pNN.json (old value kept as src_original) and clears foreign_images.
Every Admin API call retries up to 6 times on errors. Prints one summary line at the end; exit 1 if anything is
still foreign.
